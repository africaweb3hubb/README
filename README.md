 Our Traction: Proven Impact

Africaweb3hub isn't just an idea; it's a movement with measurable results. Our community-driven approach has already achieved significant scale:

· 10,000+ Web3 Learners trained since 2023 through bootcamps and online resources.
· 200+ Merchants in Goma and Kinshasa are actively testing crypto payment solutions, primed for migration to Solana.
· 20+ DApps Launched by our alumni, spanning DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and real-world utility applications.
· 5 University Partnerships with institutions like Université de Kinshasa to integrate blockchain into curricula.
· 3 Successful Hackathons hosted, with an average of 150 participants each.

We've achieved this with minimal funding. Now, we're leveraging this proven foundation to accelerate Solana adoption.

 Our Solana Mission

Our new mission is to become the foremost hub for Solana development and adoption in Francophone Africa. We are executing a three-pillar strategy:

1. Localized Education: Translating and creating high-quality Solana (Rust & Anchor) documentation, tutorials, and bootcamp curricula in French and Swahili.
2. Developer Tools: Building open-source toolkits that solve real African problems, starting with Solana Pay integrations for mobile money systems (Orange Money, MTN Mobile Money).
3. Community Infrastructure: Providing free, high-performance RPC nodes, validator guides, and grant support to empower our developers to build and innovate.

Vision: To bridge the gap between Solana's high-performance technology and the vast, untapped potential of Francophone Africa's developers and entrepreneurs.

 Tech Stack

Our projects primarily utilize:

· Blockchain: Solana, Rust, Anchor Framework
· Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript
· Libraries: @solana/web3.js, @solana/wallet-adapter, @solana/pay
· Infrastructure: Vercel, GitHub Actions, Solana Devnet/Testnet
